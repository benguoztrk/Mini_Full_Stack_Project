<h3>
      This is a full stack mini web app project that I build using HTML, CSS,
      React JS and Supabase with responsive design
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The app is live on: https://share-a-fact-react-project01.netlify.app/</li>
      <li>The goal of this web app is to allow users to learn new facts that they donâ€™t know. Any user can
        write and share a fact from the form button. That fact will be uploaded to the database and
        existing facts inside the database are fetched and displayed to the users. Users can also react to
        the facts by clicking emoji buttons. If a fact is more negative emoji count, it will be disputed.
        Fact categories can be filtered by clicking respective buttons.</li>
    </ul>
